  Temuulen Enebish is a Ph.D Candidate in Epidemiology at the Department of Preventive Medicine at USC. His research interests include satellite remote sensing of air quality, spatial statistics, environmental and reproductive epidemiology. He is a former Fulbright scholar and committed to "leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition".
  
  He helped establish ["Innovation"](http://innovations.mn/), a Mongolian medical journal, during his medical school years and was involved in the founding of [Mongolian Field Epidemiology Training Programme](https://www.tephinet.org/training-programs/mongolia-field-epidemiology-training-program) while working at the WHO Representative Office in Mongolia. He has high hopes of going back to his home country after getting his degree and help in training of next generation of Mongolian epidemiologists as well as work on introducing R software into Mongolian public health community.
